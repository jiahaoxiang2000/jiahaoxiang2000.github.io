title:  "Hello Godot"
---

By following the Godot documentation, the goal of this project is to create a simple 2D game using the Godot engine. This project serves two purposes: learning the engine and understanding the game development process.

## The Game

The game is a simple 2D platformer. The player can move left, right, up, and down using the `W`, `A`, `S`, and `D` keys. Pressing the `Enter` key starts the game. When the player collides with an enemy, the game is over. You can play the game [here](https://jiahaoxiang2000.github.io/hello-godot/).

## Coding

The coding follows the Godot documentation on the [First 2D Game](https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/getting_started/first_2d_game/index.html). The game is written in GDScript, a high-level, dynamically typed programming language used in the Godot engine. GDScript is similar to Python but is optimized for the Godot engine, offering features like the language server for development in VS Code.

## Deploying the Game

Initially, the plan was to distribute the game for Windows. However, automated deployment support in the Godot engine via GitHub Actions is limited. Therefore, the game is deployed to GitHub Pages. The game is available at [this link](https://jiahaoxiang2000.github.io/hello-godot/).
