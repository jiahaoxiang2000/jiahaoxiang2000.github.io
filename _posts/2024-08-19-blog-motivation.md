### Motivation

Starting a blog has been on my mind for a long time, but procrastination always got in the way. The questions of what to write, how to write, and how to maintain it were daunting. The main motivation is the desire to share many fun projects with others. Thus, the decision was made to start a blog to share thoughts, ideas, and projects in one common place.

### Writing Principles

1. **Completeness:** Projects discussed will be complete, easy to understand, and replicate.
2. **Concise:** Blog posts will be kept short and to the point. If somebody insists on more details, they can find in the reference.
